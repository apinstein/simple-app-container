Tasks to bootstrap an "application" user container:

USER PERMISSIONS
1) add user "app"; install ssh key
2) add group "app-web" (means both app and httpd user can access files)

RUNIT
3) create ~app/service directory (app can symlink services there as needed)
4) create ~root/app-runsvdir && install service code (run & finish), w/chpst to app/app-web
5) symlink ~root/app-runsvdir to /service

SUDO
6) give sudo apachectl restart privs to app

ANYTHING ELSE?

Applications can now manage themselves:
- Install services via "ln -s /path/to/service ~/app/service
- Restart apache via "sudo apachectl restart"
- Managing cron deployments via "crontab /path/to/crontab"
